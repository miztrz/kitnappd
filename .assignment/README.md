## R7 - Identification of the _problem_ you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace _app_.

Hi there! Thanks for reading my README. I'm sure you are very excited to be viewing this, and I'm hoping you'll still be thrilled once I've shown you how this app is going to change your life forever.

When I woke up this morning, I was struck by a thought that it would be marvellous to be able to have a kitten tea party. You see, I have a pet kitten. He's nearly 4 months old, and gee is he cute. Cute enough that I want more! But sadly I cannot afford more (nor will my boyfriend be particularly thrilled by the idea).

My app - kitnappd (geddit? its a kitten app!) will allow users to loan their kittens to other users in their area for kitten tea party's and other such shenanigans [[1][1]].

[1]: Shenanigans to be defined by the lawyers prior to the app's public launch date.

## R8 - Why is it a _problem_ that needs solving?

I'd like an easy way to increase my kitten ratio per household in the short term, without the 20 year commitment that comes along with owning another cat. That is a problem that definitely needs solving.

## R9 - A link (URL) to your deployed _app_ (i.e. website)

[kitnappd](https://kitnappd.herokuapp.com/) - Deployed on Heroku.
